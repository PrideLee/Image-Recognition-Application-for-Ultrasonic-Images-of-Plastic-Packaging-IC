# Image-Recognition-Application-for-Ultrasonic-Images-of-Plastic-Packaging-IC
Aerospace plastic packaging components are in high demand as reliability, and scanning acoustic microscope screening test is an effective tool to ensure them reability in space environment. I use image processing and machine learning technology to segment and recognize the failure ultrasonic image of plastic components.
